# 🧠 Robust Brain Tumor Classification  

This project focuses on building a **deep learning-based model** to classify brain tumors from MRI images.  
Using **CNN, VGG16, and ResNet101 architectures**, I implemented ensemble learning techniques to improve performance, achieving **99.09% accuracy** across four tumor types.
